In this short guide you'll get started with Godot 4.2 _quickly_, using the 3D Platformer Starter Kit by Kenney.

It will look something like this:

If you follow along, we'll make it _even_ cooler.

# Requirements
<!--
You don't need to have tried Godot or any other game engine before.

*It's an advantage to have tried text based programming before (like Python or JavaScript) to better understand the code examples, but it's also OK to start out just copy-pasting the examples.*

If this is your first experience with Godot, you may want check out these links first:
-->
* Read [Introduction to Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/introduction_to_godot.html) ðŸ”— - if you are new to Godot.
* [Download & "Install" Godot](../install.md) - if you have not got it already.

# Step by Step

# The Godot Editor

If this is your first Godot experience, you may want to familiarize yourself with some of the key concepts here:

* _Optional:_ Read [Overview of Godot's key concepts](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/key_concepts_overview.html) ðŸ”—
* _Optional:_ Read [First look at Godot's editor](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/first_look_at_the_editor.html) ðŸ”—

For now, though, we'll focus our attention on the _3D viewport_.

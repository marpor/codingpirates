title: Mouse Look
---
# {{ page.title }}

## Default game controls

Even though you can move your played with WASD and look around with arrow keys, the way the look is organized is a bit different from regular 3rd person games.

If you look at the scene organization and the `view.gd` script, you can notice, that the camera is not actually attached to the player, and the camera position is updated via code

*You can see the Camera object is not under the Player object*


```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta):
	
	# Set position and rotation to targets
	
	self.position = self.position.lerp(target.position, delta * 4)
```

With this organization, player's movement directions are always relative to the camera rotation:
- Player's forward direction - `W` key - always points to the direction of the camera
- Player's backward direction - `S` key - always points to the direction opposite of the camera
- Player's left/right directions - `A`/`D` keys - always point left/right from the camera

## Delete current camera

First, we need to delete currect camera and everything that's related to it.

1. Delete the `View` and `Camera` objects from the scene

![image](https://github.com/oxeg/codingpirates/assets/2689981/09878fb7-161e-49b3-b9aa-b8d36974295d)

2. Open `player.gd` script and remove all mentions of the `view` reference (remove all the following lines)

```gdscript
...
@export var view: Node3D
...
input = input.rotated(Vector3.UP, view.rotation.y).normalized()

movement_velocity = input * movement_speed * delta
...
```

## Create camera attached to the player

Now we need to create a new camera, that's attached to the player.

1. Open `Player` scene in editor by either clicking "Open in editor button" or right clicking the player and selecting "Open in editor"

2. You should see the Player scene in 3D view. On the left side select the `Player` and click plus sign. Find `Node3D` and click `Create`. Name this node `CameraCenter` - this will be the attachment point for the camera

3. Now select the `CameraCenter` and click plus sign. Find `Camera3D` and click `Create`.

4. Select the `Camera3D` and move it a little bit behind the player. Rotate it so it points to the player. And make sure to enable `Current` checkbox

![image](https://github.com/oxeg/codingpirates/assets/2689981/fdb3ee63-e2b6-41f9-8ebc-bc37ce5634e6)
*You can use these camera Position and Rotation values as an example*

## Updating player controls

We have camera attached to the player, now we need to update the controls and enable mouse look.

First, let's create a new input action, that will allow us ot use mouse look only with right mouse pressed.

1. Open `Project` -> `Project settings` and switch to the `Input Map` tab

![image](https://github.com/oxeg/codingpirates/assets/2689981/62a28937-254b-4b3c-af0c-5a078c728cdc)

2. In the `Add new action` field type `mouse_look_activated` and click `Add` button

![image](https://github.com/oxeg/codingpirates/assets/2689981/fa767b9d-4274-4287-b3e6-8785f76f5498)

3. Scroll down to the new `mouse_look_activated`, click the Plus sign and select `Mouse Buttons` -> `Mouse Right Button`

![image](https://github.com/oxeg/codingpirates/assets/2689981/d3c0bd77-0694-4781-a9fb-3da5a819dd53)

Then let's open the `player.gd` script and do some changes.

1. Add some movement properties to the `Properties` section (`movement_speed` and `mouse_sensivity`)

```gdscript
@export_subgroup("Properties")
@export var movement_speed = 5
@export var mouse_sensitivity = 1000
@export var jump_strength = 7
```

2. Let's cleanup the `_physics_process` function

```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta):
	
	# Handle functions
	
	handle_controls(delta)
	handle_gravity(delta)
	
	handle_effects()
	
	# Falling/respawning
	
	if position.y < -10:
		get_tree().reload_current_scene()
	
	# Animation for scale (jumping and landing)
	
	model.scale = model.scale.lerp(Vector3(1, 1, 1), delta * 10)
	
	# Animation when landing
	
	if is_on_floor() and gravity > 2 and !previously_floored:
		model.scale = Vector3(1.25, 0.75, 1.25)
		Audio.play("res://sounds/land.ogg")
	
	previously_floored = is_on_floor()
```

3. Everything related to the player movement will be in the `handle_controls` function

```gdscript
func handle_controls(delta):
	# Jumping
	
	if Input.is_action_just_pressed("jump"):
		if jump_single or jump_double:
			Audio.play("res://sounds/jump.ogg")
		
		if jump_double:
			gravity = -jump_strength
			
			jump_double = false
			model.scale = Vector3(0.5, 1.5, 0.5)
			
		if(jump_single): jump()
	
	# Movement

	var applied_velocity: Vector3
	var move_forward = Input.get_axis("move_back", "move_forward")
	applied_velocity += transform.basis.z * move_forward * movement_speed
	
	var move_sideways = Input.get_axis("move_right", "move_left")
	applied_velocity += transform.basis.x * move_sideways * movement_speed
	
	applied_velocity.y = -gravity
	
	velocity = applied_velocity
	move_and_slide()
```

4. For the player rotation and mouse look let's create an `input` function

```gdscript
# Mouse Look
func _input(event):
	if not Input.is_action_pressed("mouse_look_activated"):
		Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE)
		return
	Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED)
	
	if event is InputEventMouseMotion:
		rotation.y -= event.relative.x / mouse_sensitivity
		
		$CameraCenter.rotation.x += event.relative.y / mouse_sensitivity
```

4. Now if you click Save and Play - you should be able to play the game using WASD for movement and mouse look with Right Mouse Button pressed

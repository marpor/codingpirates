title: Looking Around

# {{ page.title }}

While the controls in the game are pretty typical, navigating the 3D viewport is a little more complex, so to get you started here's a few tips:

* ***Hold down the right mouse button*** to navigate like a typical game:
  * ```Move``` the mouse to look around
  * Use keys ```W```, ```A```, ```S```, ```D``` to move around
  * Scroll wheel to increase/decrease movement speed (or hold shift to speed up temporarily)
* Hold ```middle mouse``` button and move mouse to rotate the view
* ```Shift``` + ```middle mouse``` button to pan the view
* ```Mouse wheel``` to zoom in/out
* ```F``` key to focus selection (try this if you get lost!)

Now, before we get too far, it might be good to save all of our changes to a different _scene_, so we can start building out our game.

If you want another level, you can base it off an existing one like this:

* Open the scene for the level you want to duplicate
* Scene Menu, Save Scene As

![Save Scene As](../assets/save_scene_as.png)

Now we have a separate file for our scene, and this is .

* Press F6 to test the currently active scene

![Run Current Scene](../assets/run_current_scene.png)

* Or right-click on the scene file to make it the Main Scene

![Set as Main Scene](../assets/set_as_main_scene.png)

Now, if you want to make "portals" between your levels, read on [here](portals.md)...

## Auto-run to make the game a "Runner" game

Look at `player.gd`, and see if you can figure out how to make the player automatically run in one direction. Disable the steering controls, and make a level that just requires careful timing of jumps. This is a common mechanism used in mobile games.

Here's an example. Let's call it a 2Â½D runner or platformer:

# {{ page.title }}

> Created with Godot 4.2

This guide picks up where Part 1 left off, so if you haven't already completed Part 1, now's the time to do that.

# Tips

* Multi-select (with shift)
* Edit multiple
* Change X/Y/Z for multiple selected nodes

# Mini-guides

* [Duplicate Levels](./duplicate_levels.md)

* [Flags as Portals](flag_portals.md)

* [Moving Platforms](moving_platforms.md)

* [Environment](environment/index.md)

# Ideas

## 2 or more players that move together

* Try duplicating the player, and make some levels that require careful moves to succeed
* If just one falls down, you loose

Here's an example:

## Adjust player speed/jump power

* There are already properties on the Player node for this

Bonus idea:

* Take a look at player.gd and see if you can figure out how these properties show up here (hint: look for `@export`)


## Custom platforms ("modelled" in Godot)

You can use Mesh nodes with a corresponding Collision shape for custom platforms, Godot has build in Mesh shapes for boxes, cylinders and more. Or you can use the CSG nodes to build more advanced prototype levels, since these allow merging or subtracting individual shapes from each other.

## Auto-run to make the game a "Runner" game

Look at `player.gd`, and see if you can figure out how to make the player automatically run in one direction. Disable the steering controls, and make a level that just requires careful timing of jumps. This is a common mechanism used in mobile games.

Here's an example. Let's call it a 2Â½D runner or platformer:

<video controls src="3d_platformer_2d.mp4" title="2.5D Runner"></video>

Here's a variation that's also often seen in mobile games:

<video controls src="3d_platformer_runner.mp4" title="Title"></video>
